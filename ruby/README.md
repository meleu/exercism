# Learning Ruby



I'm using the exercism.org challenges to learn Ruby.

In this file I'm taking notes of the new concepts I learned with each exercise.

## Hello-World

<./hello-world/>

In the `GETTING_STARTED.md` file I saw this [Intro to TDD using minitest](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html)

## Lasagna

<./lasagna/>

The `::` notation in `Lasagna::EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` means that 
`EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` is a constant in the `Lasagna` class.
